  <!-- <p>Everything is made of something and can be broken into components. 
    The human body is made up of different organs - lungs, heart, and brain. 
    If we zoom in, we see smaller parts - different types of cells. 
    However, at the most basic level, everything living and non-living consists of atoms, 
    and they form into larger structures - molecules. 
    Suppose we stop basing our perceptions on the rules of physics and chemistry 
    and look at the world not from a scientific point of view but from an artistic perspective. 
    In that case, we get a sense of diversity and freedom to determine 
    what the world around us consists of. My theme explores the concept of composition 
    through the examples of inanimate objects, phenomenons, and other non-physical products,
    such as texts, books, and articles. I plan to update or create my entries 
    based on what I see or interact with daily. 
    Our environment is captivating and exciting to study and document, 
    and each entry I submit will dive deeper into this theme. </p> -->
